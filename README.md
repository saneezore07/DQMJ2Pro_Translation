This fork of Ceris White's Joker 2 Professional repository includes a post-game translation by Gerb, bits and pieces or remaining Japanese text has been replaced with a draft machine-learning translation, pending proper localisation. 

[Guide to patch your legally obtained rom.](https://github.com/saneezore07/DQMJ2Pro_Translation/blob/translation/gerbs-postgame-translation/patching_guide/patching_guide.md)

There is an unofficial english translation by GemSlime of a copyrighted Joker 2 Professional save editor utility on the internet. Although the original may be considered abandonware, I can't host it here. It is titled:
`DQMJ2 Pro English Save Editor (Translated by Gemslimee) Translation Version 1.2 Program Version 0.6.0.7 Copyright asa-o.net`

You will need the J2P ROM, BLZ, ndstool (<https://github.com/devkitpro/ndstool>), and python. A compiled build of BLZ is provided for Windows as blz_win.exe; The scripts expect it to be named blz.exe when used.
You will have to find a compiled ndstool or build it yourself.
The ndstool command I usually use comes out to this (inside of a `Pro_ROM` folder):
`../ndstool -x ../DQMJ2P.nds -7 arm7.bin -9 arm9.bin -d data_dir -y overlay_dir -t banner.bin -h header.bin -y7 y7.bin -y9 y9.bin -t banner.bin -o logo.bin`
and to make the new ROM after changing things:
`../ndstool -c ../edited.nds -7 arm7.bin -9 arm9.bin -d data_dir -y overlay_dir -t banner.bin -h header.bin -y7 y7.bin -y9 y9.bin -t banner.bin -o logo.bin`

- arm9tool.py: Compresses and decompresses the arm9.bin file; You will need to put a copy of the decompressed arm9.bin in Pro_Tools as Pro_ARM9.bin for msgtool to work. `python Pro_Tools/arm9tool.py decompress Pro_ROM/arm9.bin Pro_Tools/Pro_ARM9.bin`
- find_untranslated.py: `python Pro_Tools/find_untranslated.py <directory>` will list every file with JP characters inside it. Use with `-v` to print the exact line numbers and strings themselves.
- msgtool.py: extracts strings. `python Pro_Tools/msgtool.py extract Pro_ROM/data_dir STRINGS/` will extract the msg files to a new STRINGS directory. `python Pro_Tools/msgtool.py repack STRINGS/ OUTPUT/` will rebuild the files to OUTPUT
- storytool.py: extracts scripts. `python Pro_Tools/storytool.py disasm Pro_ROM/data_dir SCRIPTS/` will extract the script files to a new SCRIPTS directory. `python Pro_Tools/storytool.py asm SCRIPTS/ OUTPUT/` will rebuild the files to OUTPUT

Extract the strings and scripts, edit them, rebuild them to OUTPUT, copy the contents of OUTPUT to data_dir (`cp OUTPUT/* Pro_ROM/data_dir/`) and then rebuild with ndstool. Finally, test your changes by running edited.nds in your emulator of choice.

Newly added:
- apply_patches.py: Provides an interface for applying patches to the ROM directory, including the above and some other optional patches.
- performpatch.py: Automatically applies the necessary patches + swaps the gender icons for polarity icons, then builds the translated files for you. For people who only want to play the translated game.
