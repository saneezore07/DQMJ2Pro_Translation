## Playing on an R4

### Too Long; Didn't Read:
You need to flash your old R4 with [pico_launcher](https://github.com/LNH-team/pico-launcher).

### How to play on an R4
1. Go to [this setup](https://sanrax.github.io/flashcart-guides/cart-guides/dspico/) and find your specific R4 card. ![img](b.png)
2. [Format](https://sanrax.github.io/flashcart-guides/tutorials/formatting/) your R4 SD card (after you back up your files) and follow the installation guide under the **pico_loader** tab *specifically*.
3. Load your patched ROM onto your SD card.
4. Play.

### My R4 card isn't listed on the guide website!
R4 has a long history of clones/imitations/copycats, resulting in slightly or very different hardware/software/firmware across many, many different variations, resulting in spotty support. Consider [purchasing](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005011543735291.html) a [DSpico](https://www.lnh-team.org/) for ~11 USD (usually cheaper for first-time buyers, one player purchased for ~4 USD). It is a modern cutting-edge 'R4' flashcart with developer-friendly openness and consistent support.

### Why is this necessary?
It seems that applying the `Anti-Piracy patch`, a hexadecimal edit to the ROM file, does not play nice with the old R4 kernels' method of ROM booting, causing a white-screen freeze at game boot. But unfortunately this game's anti-piracy basically makes playing the game impossible. Pico_launcher was built-in anti-piracy circumvention, without requiring ROMs to be directly patched.<br>

**Mow of the DS(i) Mode Hacking discord says:**<br>
Pico_Loader uses overlay IDs and offsets within the overlay to dynamically patch DS protect. It is much more robust than most other loaders.<br>
Typically AP patches wrk by changing the end of MIi_UncompressBackward from a `bxlr` into a `b 02000XXX` where `XXX` is somwhere ~000-700. Then at that location they have some procedure that loads a random memory address, compares it with some other value, and if it matches then it loads a random memory address, compares it with some other value, and if it matches then it replaces some memory address with pointers to nearby functions.<br>
Pico_Loader already does this automatically, I have a pending fix that just removes the jump if its in that area, which should at least be better than crashing just about all of the patches from NDS Scene ROM tool.<br>
This game [sic. DQMJ2P] has this at 02000500
